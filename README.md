Paper "CALCULATION AND OBTAINING OF PARAMETERS TO GENERATE THERMAL CYCLES BY MEANS OF PID CONTROL IN A NON-PRESSURIZED CLOSED SYSTEM FOR MATERIALS TEST"
 Mathematical model of the COPAGETEC system 
 In order to provide a theoretical model of the proposed system, it is necessary to identify the result that is desired to be obtained.
 In this way, a series of data can be provided that will help produce this model. Table 1 presents some essential and required
 data that allow the selection of materials, control elements, sensors and final control elements.
